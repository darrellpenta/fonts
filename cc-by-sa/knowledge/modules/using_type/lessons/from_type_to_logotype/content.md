From Type to Logotype  \\\
By Tom Muller for GFK. \\\
Draft 02 (Final Draft) October 24, 2022. \\\
 \\\
**Intro: Why logos still matter. \\\
**Ah yes, the perennial question (or argument depending on your point of view) that provides endless nourishment for the design Twitterati and design influencers. It\'92s a moot discussion of course because\'97surprise\'97logos matter, maybe now more so than ever. Now that I\'92m on my soapbox I\'92d like to argue that case, and explain through my own creative process how a successful logo is created: from driving the initial idea through the sketch and design process through delivery and application. Along the way I\'92ll explain the creative decisions I make in order to achieve a result that inspires and hopefully resonates with the audience\'97effectively communicating the idea, product or brand. \\\
 \\\
As design, branding and marketing have evolved since the mid 1950s\'97roughly the birth of modern corporate graphic design and marketing as we know it today\'97so has the role of the logo, that stalwart of visual and brand identities. It was\'97and is\'97the first thing someone sees when connecting to a brand or product. It's the signifier that (hopefully) pulls you deeper into the world of the brand that you\'92re pursuing. \
\
It used to be enough that you just placed the logo on whatever you wanted to use to market your brand and that was it. Your identity was defined by the logo and how that logo was placed on everything from letterheads to vehicles to coffee cups. But, as we all know, we now live in a world where a logo has become a much smaller part in a very big ecosystem that involves language and empathy, sound and motion, messaging and positioning. Having a logo alone isn\'92t enough anymore to connect an audience with your brand and message. BUT (big but), your logo is still that vital first impression. That little graphic that people see and associate with your brand. The swoosh, the apple, the G, the camera, the bird, the music note\'85 they all immediately conjure up images of what those brands mean to you, beyond the actual logo. If you get your branding right, your logo will become a mark of quality, of connection, of belonging\'97and people will want to own a part of it.  \\\
 \\\
And now, with everyone living on their devices, the logo has found more relevance than ever\'97becoming the literal gateway into your digital world. \\\
 \\\
However we\'97and the way we consume content and interact with brands\'97change, one thing will remain constant: We all need symbols and marks that represent the things that surround us. Whether they were carved on stone tablets or an icon on your phone\'92s home screen, the need for a visual shorthand that communicates ideas and messages is here to stay. \\\
 \\\
ONWARDS!\
\
**What\'92s in a logo? A logo, a logomark, and a logotype walk into a bar. \\\
**Before we get going, a quick reminder on the ways to correctly describe logos: a logo can come in various shapes, components and sizes. When we say \'93logo,\'94 it usually encompasses everything that encompasses it: a specific combination of elements (graphics and text) that results in a unique design, like the Google Android logo.  When we say \'93logo\'94, we\'92re usually talking about a unique combination of elements\'97primarily type and graphics\'97 that together create a unique and recognisable design, for example Target, AirBnB, Instagram, etc. \
\
A logo_mark _is the specific graphic element, symbol or icon (e.g. the Nike Swoosh, or the Apple er\'85 apple) that represents the company or brand. A logo_type_ (also known as a wordmark) is a specific typographic design of the naming. Sometimes it can be as simple as [choosing the right typeface](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/choosing_type/a_checklist_for_choosing_type) and writing it out, but usually you\'92ll spend time customizing the letterforms to create something unique and ownable\'97the Nike  logo is a great example of that. \\\
 \\\
When you\'92re designing a logo for a company, more often than not you\'92ll end up creating assets  that consist of both a logomark and logotype: a strong graphic symbol paired with a bespoke wordmark that really represents all the qualities of the brand. But something interesting has been happening the last decade or so: Logos need to be infinitely flexible.\
\
 \\\
It used to be enough to ask yourself \'93Can it fax?\'94 If your design survived the low quality transmission of the faxing process and came out legible on the other side, you passed. Today, however, your logo needs to work as an (app) icon, on responsive websites, on TV, on billboards, T-shirts, tote bags, and Twitch avatars, just to name a few applications\'97resulting in an emphasis on the logomark as a vital part of any visual identity toolkit. Gone are the days where your logo is only presented in one static lockup across every single application. \
\
Today, a successful logo is one that can be pulled apart into its single components and reconfigured in different ways without ever losing its essence and character. The multicolored Google logo reduces into a G icon on your phone, or when it is paired with another part of the wider Google brand ecosystem. It can move and bounce and rotate, and it informs a much bigger identity system. In the heading of this page, for example, the logo is small and single-color. And with the brand\'92s colors applied to a new Google Fonts icon, we never lose track that it\'92s \'93Google.\'94 Wherever you interact with that logo\'97whether it is on your phone, in a TV ad, across a billboard, or even that little G on a Google Home device\'97the experience of connecting with the brand and a logo that moves from logomark to logotype is seamless.  \\\
 \\\
And with all this in mind, let\'92s get started on our project\'97putting everything into practice, and design a logotype. \\\
 \\\
**From Type to Logotype! \\\
** \\\
For our evergreen subject matter we\'92ll tackle something future-facing which will, hopefully, stay relevant for a long time: A moon mission! (I admit I\'92m a bit of a sci-fi and space geek; and with the recent developments in the American Space Program it looks like we actually might send people back to the moon in the next few years\'97so lets do a bit of speculative design to riff on that.) Welcome to **_LUNA 2035_**, the next crewed mission to the moon! \\\
 \\\
So, I said at the start of this section I\'92d design a logotype. However, since a logomark is nowadays so vital to a successful and versatile logo, let\'92s make that a part of the final project. \\\
 \\\
**The Process \\\
**\
\
As with a real client project, I want to set us a brief, mainly to build guardrails around the work I\'92m intending to do and clarify exactly what I\'92m aiming to achieve at the end of this mini project. \\\
 \\\
The goal is to design a logo for _LUNA 2035_, a fictional, future, crewed moon mission. The logo will need to be future-forward and evocative of human progress; the endeavor of humankind exploring space\'97a little bit of that space-age optimism blended through a modern lens. (Note: Because this is obviously a fictitious mission, I\'92m refraining from using any official NASA or JPL logos). The end result will be the _LUNA 2035_ logo, with supporting typographic and presentation treatments. \\\
 \\\
With the brief set, I begin the creation process by doodling and sketching concepts on paper. I find this is a quick, intuitive, and fluid way to instigate, refine and define ideas; rather than dive into digital design straight away. \\\
 \\\
As I\'92m sketching I\'92m also thinking of which typefaces I will use for the logo. \\\
(Quick reminder: A typeface is the distinct design of a family of related fonts, e.g. Roboto. A specific weight and style within the family is a font, i.e. Roboto Bold). \\\
 \\\
Choosing the right typeface is an art in and of itself and can make or break your design and how it communicates with your intended audience. (If you want to get deeper into this subject I recommend you read [A checklist for choosing type \'96 Fonts Knowledge](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/choosing_type/a_checklist_for_choosing_type)).\
\
For this project it can be easy to get sidetracked into pastiche sci-fi design\'97the book [Typeset In The Future](https://typesetinthefuture.com/) is a wonderful treasure trove of Sci-Fi typography\'97which is what I want to avoid. Even though this is all speculative, I want the design to have verisimilitude.  \\\
 \\\
**Designing the logo \\\
**\
\
With any project of this kind I will always start with pen and paper sketching. I know, I know\'97its not a revolutionary idea. But the speed at which you can dot ideas on a page beats any app by miles. It just allows you to let ideas (good and bad ones) flow freely and get to a result very quickly. In my own practice I\'92ve had logo designs approved based purely on a sketch. More famous examples are Paula Sher\'92s _Citi_ sketch and Trevor Key\'92s napkin doodle of the _Virgin_ logo. \\\
 \\\
As I\'92m sketching I\'92m aiming for a few things: \\\
	\
\
\
\
* An iconic, minimal mark (icon) that I can use as a graphic device with the wordmark, and that allows me to play with different lockups.\
* Clean, geometric shapes. Maybe I can replace certain letters in \'93LUNA\'94 with a graphic shape?\
* Modernity: I want a simple, clean and timeless look.\
\
As you can see, most of the sketches are mainly a variation of writing the word \'93LUNA\'94 in different ways, editing shapes, customizing letters, etc. I want to start from an existing typeface and edit that, so I\'92m consciously avoiding creating \'91out there\'92 designs (see also my point about verisimilitude).  \\\
 \\\
Once I feel I\'92m getting to a conceptual place I like, I begin to translate my sketches into vectors. My go-to tool for this is Adobe Illustrator (sometimes in combination with the Adobe Capture app on my iPhone to photograph and convert sketches into SVG files I can import in Illustrator).  If you\'92re not using Adobe Illustrator, there are many other applications like Affinity Designer, Figma or Sketch that are great tools for this part of the design process. Now I start to edit down the list of typefaces I\'92ve been researching since I began the project. My initial selection yields a few interesting choices: [Rubik Mono One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik+Mono+One/tester?query=Rubik) (bold and chunky\'97interesting, but perhaps too stylised), [Goldman](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goldman/tester?category=Display,Monospace&preview.text=LUNA%20MISSION&preview.text_type=custom) (reminds me of a modern interpretation of the Mid-Century [sci-fi classic](https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/11/29/fontspots-eurostile/) [Eurostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile)), and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins&category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=LUNA%20MISSION&preview.text_type=custom) (a clean and geometric sans-serif typeface that\'92s versatile and robust). \\\
 \\\
I think it\'92s key to start looking at potential typefaces throughout the span of the creative process, rather than add it on after you\'92ve made a few sketches. Your design and type choices need to work in tandem.  \\\
 \\\
One thing I know for sure is I want to use a secondary [monospaced](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/monospaced) typeface for things like potentially displaying data and stats (hey, it\'92s a moon mission). I love [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono?category=Display,Monospace&preview.text=LUNA%20MISSION&preview.text_type=custom) and would instinctively go for that workhorse. But **[Azeret Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Azeret+Mono/tester?category=Display,Monospace&preview.text=LUNA%20MISSION&preview.text_type=custom)** has some lovely unexpected qualities that remind me of modern interpretations of typefaces like [OCR-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B) and Courier\'97which lean very close to the fonts NASA used. For inspiration you can see the [Apollo 11 Flight Plan](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/apollo50th/pdf/a11final-fltpln.pdf)\'97which uses Futura and what looks like a monospaced version of Bell Gothic (a popular typeface designed specifically for maximum legibility of dense, small copy). \\\
 \\\
Adapting the sketches into digital designs\'97and aiming at the modern, timeless look I set out to achieve\'97I choose **[Inter Tight](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter+Tight?query=inter&preview.text=LUNA%20MISSION%2001%2FONE&preview.text_type=custom)** as my primary typeface for the \'93LUNA\'94 wordmark for a few reasons. Firstly, the aforementioned timelessness. Looking at how NASA uses Helvetica, I want to stay close, but look at a more contemporary iteration, one that also works great on-screen. Inter ticks all those boxes, but I feel Inter Tight adds a little extra character to the way text is typeset that strikes a perfect balance between what\'92s past and what\'92s tomorrow. And,and importantly, Azeret Mono [pairs](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/choosing_type/pairing_typefaces) really nicely with it.  \\\
 \\\
Sometimes typeface choices really come down to \'93does it evoke the right feeling?\'94 And even the basic geometry of an open or two-storey \'91a\'92 can make all the difference in how it evokes the brand or project it represents. \\\
\
\
With my typeface choices made I can now work at speed, creating iterations of the \'93LUNA\'94 and \'93LUNA MISSION\'94 lockups. As you see, I\'92ve subtly tweaked the letterforms of the \'91U\'92 and \'91A\'92 in \'93LUNA\'94 to make them look slightly more like geometric shapes. I\'92ve also removed the crossbar in the \'91A\'92 (it feels like an appropriate nod to NASA\'92s Worm logo) and replaced it with two dots: one for the Moon and one for Earth. With some fine-tuning, the distance between the dots is an accurate and to-scale graphic of the distance between them, reflecting the history and significance of the event (see also this graphic: [https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/348/apollo-mission-flight-plan-1967/](https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/348/apollo-mission-flight-plan-1967/)) \\\
 \\\
Having iterated the designs I arrive at the final results of the logo and logotype in the various lockups. \\\
 \\\
**The logo \\\
**\
\
The final result is a contemporary and (hopefully) timeless \'93LUNA 2035\'94 logo that can be used and adapted across a variety of touchpoints\'97from the side of a launch vehicle, to the Instagram avatar of the mission\'92s social channels, to apparel and broadcast graphics.  \\\
 \\\
I\'92ve created a set of presentation hero graphics to show how the logo can be brought to life as a visual asset that represents the initiative and hopefully inspires the audience. Most of the time this is what the public at large will see, so it needs to have impact and make an immediate connection.  \\\
 \\\
**Conclusion \\\
**\
\
I used to firmly believe that every logo (and especially the ones I designed) needs to be created from bespoke typefaces, rather than use something that exists already. There are many arguments for that approach, but what I have found over the years is that _how_ you use a typeface to _create_ something unique is more important than starting with a unique typeface. If you look around you\'92ll see there are 1000s of logos that all use the same, or very similar, typefaces. And yet, each logo is unique to its brand through the added context and design details.  \\\
 \\\
It\'92s about knowing what\'92s right for any given project. You can achieve great solutions by the smallest interventions; and often using the tools and ingredients that are already out there will give you the perfect starting point to build something exciting that resonates with everyone.\
