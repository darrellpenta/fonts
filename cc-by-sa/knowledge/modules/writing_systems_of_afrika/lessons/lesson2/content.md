One of the most truly amazing scripts out of Afrika is the Bamum script, invented by King Ibrahim Njoya in 1896. He not only invented a writing system for his people aged 25, the Bamum, but he also left behind a huge collection of manuscripts detailing their history. He was truly a Renaissance man:He compiled a pharmacopœia, designed a calendar, drew maps of his kingdom, kept administrative and legal codes, and wrote a Karma Sutra-like book—all this in the writing he had invented. He also produced a large collection of drawings that are still housed in the museum that he developed to preserve his people’s heritage.

King Ibrahim Njoya

He created this legacy for his people by putting together a group of dignitaries from among his people who were chosen for their intellect and drawing talents. With the notables, especially his cousin Ibrahim Njoya, who was a talented and prolific artist, the king was able to build a large collection of art records. Not long after he had built a magnificent palace and schools for his people, the French took control of Cameroon. Their power was threatened by his achievements. The French soldiers destroyed the printing press that he had invented, demolished the libraries, burned many of the books he had written, and threw sacred Bamum objects into the street. Finally in 1931, they sent him into exile in the capital of Yaoundé, where he died a broken man in 1933. Over the years, Njoya’s son and his heir Seidou Njimoluh quietly worked to preserve his heritage.

After Cameroon claimed its independence from the French in 1960, King Njimoluh collected those objects that had been attacked and put them in his father’s museum to be kept safe. King Njimoluh ruled from 1933 to 1992 but his grandson King Mfon Mforifoum Mbombo Njoya Mouhammad Nabil, who rules today, no longer has the political power the dynasty had before colonization. However, he continues to keep a watchful eye over the Bamum legacy.
 
When I did the research for my thesis in 1984–5, I thought that the Bamum script had died with King Njoya in 1933, but all that changed in 1997 when Howard W. French, the African correspondent, published a full-page article “Foumban Journal; Inheritors of an African Kingdom, Come and Gone” in the New York Times. I clipped it, carefully stored it away, and decided that I had to go to Foumban one day. I finally did visit while researching my “Afrikan Alphabets” book, landing in the coastal city of Douala in January 2003. Tucked on the coast and oppressively hot, this bustling city is the commercial capital of Cameroon. I flew to Yaoundé the next day to meet Bamum professors at the University, who gave me much needed information about the king and the palace. I then took a four-hour ride in a cramped minivan to Foumban, where the King’s legendary grandfather had left an incredible alphabetic legacy.

Founded in 1394, this capital of the former Bamum empire is a dust bowl in the dry months (when I visited) and a mud bath in the rainy season—a condition I could certainly envision, given the thinness of the soil, which rises easily, coating everything with its fine yellow dust, as cars zoom past at speeds far too fast for the narrow roads. The Bamum people had been keeping the artifacts of each monarch in a room under lock and key; King Ibrahim Njoya decided to put them on display for the enjoyment of his subjects. That is how the idea of a museum was born. As a result, there are some magnificent items on display, a few dating back to the 14th century.

The museum occupies the three main floors of the building, with the king’s living quarters occupying a smaller section of the grand building, which has about a hundred rooms in all. The collection, huge and impressive in scope—8,000 manuscripts—had me transfixed. I was mostly interested in Njoya’s manuscripts, feasting my eyes upon the genius of this Afrikan son. I also found it hard to comprehend why and how this gem of a building and Njoya’s legacy have remained unknown, for the most part, not only to the rest of the world but also to us Afrikans.

In 2003, I met the reigning king and grandson of King Njoya, Sultan el Hadj Ibrahim Mbombo Njoya, one evening just before sundown. Amidst the music of the court musicians, with visitors and attendants bowing and paying respect, he came out to the palace steps and stood, looking regal in his sumptuous robes. Oumarou Nchare, the Director of Cultural Affairs at the Bamum Palace, kept telling me to get ready to meet the king. Finally, Oumarou grabbed my arm and thrust me in front of Sultan Njoya and introduced me to him. Protocol be damned, I was all adrenaline as I held my hand out and he took it in a firm grip, as he welcomed me in very good English. He told me he had visited South Afrika, met Nelson Mandela, and would love to visit Zimbabwe some day. I later learned that prior to inheriting the throne in 1992, he had been a minister and diplomat for decades; this explained his worldly demeanor. Yet something about him made me feel very comfortable:he had no airs. One felt that he had a strong connection to the people. A people’s king.

## The creation of the Bamum script
King Ibrahim Njoya, the 16th king of the Bamum people, ruled between 1895 and 1931 and is believed to have started working on his script in 1896. He worked with some hand-picked scribes and developed over 500 logographs, of which 466 are known. This first phase of the script was called lewa, which means “book”. The direction of the writing was top to bottom.

The second phase, which read (along with all subsequent versions) from left to right, was developed between 1899 and 1900, and was called mbima (mixed). Njoya dropped 72 symbols and developed 45 new ones.
 
The third phase or nyi nyi nfa’ (after its first three symbols) was developed in 1902. He omitted 56 characters, leaving 371 and 10 numbers. Njoya used this system to write his “History of the Bamum People”.
The fourth phase or ril nyi nsha mfw’ (after the first four characters) was developed between 1907 and 1908 is a further simplification of the previous version. It has 285 characters and 10 numbers.
 
The fifth phase, ril nyi mfw’ men, had 195 characters and 10 digits and was used for a Bible translation. All these five systems were closely related and were all progressively simplified with logographic elements.
 
The sixth phase, a ka u ku (after its first four characters), was developed in 1910. It has 82 characters and 10 digits and was used to record births, marriages, deaths, and court rulings. 
 
There’s a seventh and last phase called mfemfe (new), or a ka u ku mfemfe, which was developed around 1918. It has 80 characters, 10 of which are both syllables and digits. Missing syllables are written with a diacritic.

## The Bamum font

We have to acknowledge the crucial work of the Bamum Scripts and Archives Project for the meticulous work they continue to do in both preserving the Bamum script and developing a Bamum font. The two principles of the project are Nji Oumarou Nchare, of the Bamum Palace in Foumban, and Dr Konrad Tuchscherer, of St. John’s University, New York. They are ably assisted by Bamum scholars and students. They also receive assistance from scholar and linguist Charles Riley from Yale University Library. 
 
They enlisted the expertise of famed typeface designer Jason Glavy, who has turned many Afrikan scripts into fonts, to create a Bamum font. Jason created all the fonts I used in my Afrikan Alphabets book way back in 2003 and I remember him for his humility. Here’s his response when I asked him about his role in creating the Bamum font:
 
“I can't really take credit for their designs.  That honor goes to a group of Bamum scholars (Mr. Nji Oumarou Nchare, Dr. Konrad Tuchscherer, etc) who sent me a number of GIFs of the glyph outlines, and I just presented them a number of variations based on a 0° angle ductus, 45° angle ductus, and a mono-weight font.  The gentlemen-scholars on the Bamum council  seemed to prefer the mono-weight and 0° angle ductus fonts most of all.  There was a bit of back-and-forth discussion, because some of the glyphs were very similar to each other. I suggested that for young (those just learning writing) and for those old who don't see all that well (like me), making glyphs as different from each other, while not greatly diverging from the original writing would be beneficial to ease of learning & legibility.  I also suggested that some sort of ductus might reduce eye fatigue / monotony.  I'm not sure how they made their final choice, but at the end of the day, it's their script, and I was just the tool making it available, digitally.  They (The Bamum) have final say-so over how they want it represented as it should be.  I am just happy to have been a part in preserving this script.”
 
Here’s a piece of text in the Noto Bamum font:
